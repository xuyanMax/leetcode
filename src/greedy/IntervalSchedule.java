 * 1 — Basic Interval Scheduling Problem
 * Our objective is to maximize the number of selected intervals in a given time-frame.
 * Formally speaking, we have a set of requests {1, 2, …, n};
 * the i-th request corresponds to an interval of time starting at s(i) and finishing at f(i).
 * A subset of the requests is compatible if no two of them overlap in time,
 * and our goal is to accept as large a compatible subset as possible.
